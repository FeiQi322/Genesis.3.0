README_GENESIS
--------------

The tar file targenv3.0 contains source code, runscripts, and data input files 
used to compile, link and run the GENESIS version 3 Global Climate Model.
Type "tar xvf targenv3.0" to extract the following, which are all written 
under a top-level directory Genesis.3.0/:

  Agcm/                   AGCM source code
  Lsx/                    LSX (surface module) source code     
  Eve/src3/               EVE (one of several vegetation models) source code 
  Exec/makegenv3all       make file to compile and link GCM executable file
  Runpres/                run a sample modern simulation
  Datafiles/Modern/       data input files, ascii-map format, T31 & 2X2 resols
  Utilities/              miscellaneous pre or post-processing utilities
  Docs/                   documentation: V2 Users Guide, V2+,V3 release notes

There are README_... files in the top-level directory (this file), and in
Runpres, Utilites, and Docs. More detailed information is contained 
in the V2.0 User's Guide, and in V2+,V3 release notes in the Docs directory.

To compile and link an executable file, go to Exec/, and type
  "gmake -f makegenv3all"

The code has previously been compiled and run on Cray, IBM/SP, Sun, SGI, 
and various Linux systems using the Intel Fortran compiler (ifort). 
The makefile and run scripts supplied with this release are set up for Linux, 
and may need slight editing for your system - see comments in the make file, 
the script Runpres/debpres, and post-processing programs in Utilites/. 

To run the sample modern siumulation, go to Runpres/, and type 
  "runpres >&! outfile &"

Both the make file (makegenv3all) and the run script file (debpres) may need
to be edited slightly to tailor to your machine - see comments in those files.
