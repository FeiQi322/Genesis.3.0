                     Release Notes for GENESIS 2.0                       7/26/95
                     =============================                       =======


A new version 2.0 of GENESIS is available to the GENESIS user community.
The purpose of these notes is mainly to outline the new physics in version 2.0,
since no other written descriptions will be available until papers are prepared
for publication (see below). First we mention a few topics of general interest,
and then list the main physical features in version 2.0 that are new or changed
from version 1.02.


VERSION 2.0 USER'S GUIDE
------------------------

A full-length version 2.0 GENESIS User's Guide is available that contains
complete descriptions of Namelist parameters, job scripts and data input files.
Note that there are many new Namelist parameters in version 2, and several
new data input files. Also there are several version 1.02 Namelist parameters
that are not accepted by version 2. Therefore users will have to modify old
version 1.02 job scripts and Namelist inputs in order to use them with
version 2.0. On the other hand, the version 2.0 model can be restarted from 
version 1.02 restart files with different resolutions from the current
model (see below).


GENESIS FTP SITE
----------------

Most version 2.0 files available to the GENESIS user community can be accessed
by anonymous ftp to biscuit.cgd.ucar.edu, cd to pub/v2.0. See Appendix C in
the version 2.0 User's Guide for further information.


GENESIS MAIL GROUP
------------------

An email group for the GENESIS user community has existed for some time,
with about 50 current members. By sending email to:
   genesis@ncar.ucar.edu
you message will be broadcast to the whole group. Users are encouraged to make
use of this mail group to compare notes on proposed and current usage of
the GENESIS model, to ask or answer questions of general interest, etc. If you
are not sure whether you are on it, or want to be added or removed, contact:
   pollard@ncar.ucar.edu.


PUBLICATIONS
------------

A reference list of all GENESIS-related publications known to us is maintained
in the anonymous ftp area (file `genrefs'). This is meant to include papers by
all users that are published or in press; if you have any relevant papers not

NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2.0 COMPARED TO VERSION 1.02
----------------------------------------------------

--------
General:
--------

* The standard model resolutions that the model is tuned to and used for
  the control runs are:
    T31 (3.75 x 3.75 degrees) and 18 levels for the AGCM.
    2x2 degrees for the surface models.
  Version 1.02 used an AGCM resolution of R15 (7.5 x 4.5 deg) and  12 levels.
  Roughly speaking, three of the additional layers in version 2.0 are in the
  planetary boundary layer and three are in the stratosphere.

* Version 2.0 can be initialized from version 1.02 restart files. 
  Also the horizontal and vertical resolutions of the restart file can differ
  from those of the current model, in which case the input fields are 
  interpolated to the model resolution as the file is read in (see Namelist
  parameters HORRES, LEVRES, and HORRESLSX).

* The format of GENESIS history files is unchanged from version 1.02, with two
  minor exceptions. In order to flag whether the machine binary representation
  of a file is CRAY or IEEE, bytes 5-8 of the first record of a file are 
  either "CRAY" or "IEEE" (so the first 8 bytes are now "CCM CRAY", "CCM IEEE",
  "LSX CRAY" or "LSX IEEE"; bytes 5-8 were blank in version 1.02). The second
  change is that the 8th word on the first record (overall model version number)
  is now ascii and not real type. These changes may require minor modifications
  to post-processing programs which check words 1 and 8.


----------------
Atmospheric GCM:
----------------

* The AGCM uses a hybrid coordinate system, which tends from sigma coordinates
  [pressure/surface pressure] near the ground to [pressure/reference pressure]
  at the top of the atmosphere (Simmons et al., 1989, Meteorol.Atmos.Phys., 40,
  28-60).

* Clouds are predicted using prognostic 3-D water cloud amounts (kg/kg)
  (eg, Smith, 1990, QJRMS, 116, 435-460; Senior and Mitchell, 1993, J.Climate,
  6, 393-418). Three separate prognostic cloud fields are kept for stratus,
  convective and anvil cirrus clouds, which are advected by semi-Lagrangian
  transport, and mixed vertically by convective plumes and background diffusion.
  Cloud evaporation, conversion to precipitation, aggregation by falling
  precipitation, re-evaporation of falling precipitation, and turbulent
  deposition of lowest-layer cloud particles onto the surface are all included.
  Latent heat changes due to liquid vs. ice clouds are neglected (as if all
  clouds are liquid), although the determination of cloud fraction, radiative
  properties and microphysical parameters take the temperature (above/below
  freezing) into account. Cloud fractions for each type  are proportional
  to the grid-box average cloud amounts.

  Since this cloud scheme is quite different from that in version 1.02, all
  cloud amounts are initialized to zero when restarting from a version 1.02
  restart file, and take several days to spin up to normal amounts.

* "Extra" cloud absorption of solar radiation (Cess, et al., 1995, Science, 267,
  496-499; Ramanathan et al., 1995, Science, 267, 499-503) is accounted for by
  a decrease in cloud single-scattering albedos, except in high southern
  latitudes with a linear transition to higher albedos from 40 to 60 deg S.
  The global net solar absorption by the model atmosphere is ~86 W/m2
  (about 30 W/m2 due to clouds) and the ratio of the global mean cloud 
  radiative forcing at the surface to that at the top of the atmosphere is 1.61.

* Uniform mixing ratios of greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC11 and CFC12 can
  now be prescribed individually and their effects are treated explicitly in
  the infrared radiation code; this work was done and and the code contributed
  to GENESIS by Prof. Wei-Chyung Wang's group at SUNY/Albany (Wang et al., 1991,
  Nature, 350, 573-577).

* Atmospheric ozone can now be prescribed from 3-D monthly climatological
  fields, formed by combining 2-D global maps of total column ozone with zonal
  mean cross sections versus latitude and height. This work was done and the
  data files contributed to GENESIS by Prof. Wei-Chyung Wang's group at 
  SUNY/Albany (Wang et al., 1995, Atmos.Res., in press; Liang and Wang, 1995,
  "Atmospheric Ozone as a Climate Gas", NATO ASI Series, 259-288).

* The single-level cloud approximation in the solar radiation code (Thompson
  et al., 1987, J.Geophys.Res., 92, 10942-10960) has been removed; now 
  delta-Eddington calculations are made for clear and cloudy fractions of
  each layer, and random cloud overlap is assumed between layers.

* The solar and infrared effects of background tropospheric dust aerosols is
  included. A global uniform total column amount of aerosols is prescribed over
  all non-ice land points, with a prescribed exponential decrease in height.

* Various parameters in the convective plume parameterization have been tuned
  for better results. Also PBL plumes (those triggered by surface fluxes) can
  now condense and precipitate; in version 1.02 they were always assumed
  to be dry. The prescribed plume radius is 2000 m for "free" plumes and 
  200 m for PBL plumes, and the fractional plume area is .01 for free plumes,
  .005 for PBL plumes over land, and 0.2 for PBL plumes over ocean.

* Gravity wave drag is included following MacFarlane (1987, J.Atmos.Sci., 44,
  1775-1800).

* Courant spectral truncation is applied in the upper few layers of the 
  atmosphere (Simmons et al., 1989, Meteorol.Atmos.Phys., 40, 28-60), allowing
  a 0.5 hour timestep at T31 resolution. This seems to have eliminated the
  tendency of version 1.02 to occasionally blow up due to CFL instability in
  the stratospheric jets.

* A spectral filter is applied to the agcm topography field in order to reduce
  Gibbs-truncation ripples near large steep topographic features (mainly the
  Andes, Himalayas and Antarctica), using the "physical-space" filter of
  Navarra et al., 1994, J.Climate, 7, 1169-1183, section 6b.

* The code has the capability of advecting an arbitrary number of passive 3-D
  tracers, transporting them by semi-Lagrangian transport and mixing them
  vertically by plume convection and background diffusion. However a user
  interface for this capability has not been fully developed, and the code must
  be modified slightly and re-compiled for particular applications.


----------------------------------
Land-Surface-Transfer Model (LSX):
----------------------------------

* For each surface-grid box (2x2 degrees in the standard resolution),
  a fractional amount of open water can be specified. These fractions are
  actually input as a global map in a new data input file (FWATER). There
  is a separate calculation in LSX for the surface <-> AGCM fluxes for the
  open water fraction and the land fraction, and the two sets of fluxes
  are weighted together into the effective flux contribution for each 2x2 cell.

  The open water is a well-mixed column with prognostic temperature, just as
  for the open-ocean slab model. Floating ice can form if the column reaches the
  freezing point, and snow can accumulate on the ice, modelled by the same code
  as for thermodynamic sea ice. The water depth can have one of two values 
  representing "coastal ocean/deep lakes" or "shallow lakes", with default
  values of 50 m and 5 m respectively; (the distinction is encoded by using
  positive or negative percent values in the FWATER file).

* Data files for land-ocean-icesheet mask (SURFTYP), topography (TOPOG) and
  open water fraction (FWATER) have been regenerated from better sources,
  using the 10 minute U.S Navy FNOC global elevation dataset (Cuming and 
  Hawkins, 1981, Report M11, FNOC, Monterey, CA; Kineman, 1985, NOAA/NGDC,
  Boulder, CO), and Cogley's 1x1 degree datasets for icesheets (Cogley, 1991,
  Note 91-1, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario).

* Vegetation can be prescribed in three different ways in version 2.0,
  described here in order of increasing complexity.

  The old version 1.02 prescription in terms of Dorman and Sellers biomes
  is still available as an option. A sub-option now exists to 
  specify one Dorman-Sellers biome as a single vegetation type for
  the whole world (using Namelist parameter DSBIOME), in which case no 
  vegetation data input file is required.

  Another option uses a new method of categorizing vegetation developed by
  Jon Foley and his group at the University of Wisconsin. Starting from
  Matthews (1985) present-day dataset, vegetation is described by four
  independent measures:
    (i)   cover type (forest, woodland, savanna, shrubland, grassland, tundra,
                      desert),
    (ii)  climate zone (tropical, temperate, boreal/subpolar),
    (iii) phenology (evergreen, deciduous), and
    (iv)  C3 or C4 understory.
  These measures are designed to capture climatically important distinctions
  rather than biome or species differences. An on-line algorithm uses the
  4-digit code, some model climate input and the calendar date to compute the
  phenology and other physical attributes of the canopy once each day. The
  climate input consists of 2-week running-mean surface-air temperature
  and an instantaneous soil-moisture stress term, so there is some interactive
  feedback between the model climate and the phenology (but not the vegetation
  distribution). A sub-option exists to specify one 4-digit vegetation code for
  the whole world (using Namelist parameter WISCVEG), in which case no 
  vegetation data input file is required.

  Another vegetation option uses present-day off-line results of a predictive
  vegetation model (EVE) developed by Jon Bergengren at NCAR. These results are
  essentially global distributions of ~110 life forms predicted by EVE driven
  by present-day observed climatology, and for each grid cell the net physical
  attributes of the vegetation community are determined and passed to LSX. 
  The required information is provided in a separate EVE data/restart file.
  To reduce the size of this file, the seasonal cycles of leaf area index
  (phenology) predicted by EVE are not stored but are re-computed on-line
  using a part of the EVE code linked to GENESIS. Since the previously computed 
  distributions and the phenology are driven by observed climate, there is
  no interactive climate-vegetation feedback in this method.

* A stochastic precipitation term is included to account for the observed
  statistics of precipitation time series at a point compared to large-scale
  averages. A random term is added to the precipitation at each 2x2 surface
  cell (linearly interpolated from the AGCM grid) at each timestep, with an
  exponential distribution based on observations, with the same mean as the
  large-scale precipitation, and with implicit fractional areas with non-zero
  precipitation of 0.3 and 0.7 for convective and stratiform precipitation
  respectively (Thomas and Henderson-Sellers, 1991, J.Climate, 4, 898-910;
  Eltahir and Bras, 1993, J.Climate, 6, 639-644).

* The calculation of PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) for the
  stomatal resistance parameterization has been improved to account for
  two levels of radiation on the sunlit and shaded fractions of the canopy.


-----------
Soil Model:
-----------

* Soil hydrologic properties (saturated matric potential and hydraulic
  conductivity, porosity, "B") and wet surface albedo are determined
  from soil sand-silt-clay ratios. The latter are in turn prescribed from a 
  global soil-texture dataset provided by Robin Webb (Webb and Rosenzweig,
  1993, Glob.Biogeochem.Cycles, 7, 97-108), which includes variations with
  depth. The soil hydraulic parameters are determined from the texture using 
  empirical formulae in Cosby et al.(1984, Water Res.Res., 20, 682-690).

  An option now exists to specify a single sand-silt-clay fraction for all soil
  layers globally (using the Namelist parameter SOILTEX), in which case no
  soil texture data input files are required.

* A ponding reservoir ("puddles") has been added at the soil surface,
  with a maximum capacity of 10 Kg/m2 of water, that acts mainly as a buffer 
  between infiltration excess and surface runoff (Miller, 1977, Water at the
  Surface of the Earth, Int.Geophys.Series, vol.21, Academic Press, pg.189).
  Prognostic amounts of liquid and frozen ponded H2O are tracked separately for
  each grid point, and the puddles can evaporate, infiltrate or contribute to
  runoff.

* The basic effect of vertical pressure gradients in saturated soils
  is included to allow the model to potentially form water tables
  or "wetlands" (saturated surface layers). This is done implicitly by
  "squeezing" any excess soil moisture (> 100%) to the next highest layer or
  out of the top of the soil after each timestep.

* The bottom boundary condition for soil moisture at 4.25 m depth is now
  10% permeability, compared to 100% permeability in version 1.02. This value
  has been chosen to yield global bottom drainage and surface runoff rates in
  better agreement with (quite uncertain) observed estimates (Probst and Sigha,
  1989, C.R.Acad.Sci.Paris, 309, II, 357-363; Zekster and Loaiciga, 1993,
  J.Hydrol., 144, 405-427).

-------------------------
Snow and Icesheet Models:
-------------------------

* The function giving snow fraction vs. total snow mass now assumes a linear
  relationship between fraction and depth below 100% cover (Donald
  et al., 1995, Water Res.Res., 31, 995-1009), as oppposed to a constant depth
  below 100% cover as in version 1.02. The depth at which the cover reaches
  100% is set equal to [geometric height * fractional cover] of the lower
  vegetation canopy, with lower and upper bounds of 20 cm and 70 cm.

* An *aposteriori* correction is applied in our post-processing codes
  that calculate the net mass balance on icesheets. This crudely accounts
  for the refreezing of a certain fraction of surface snow melt, that percolates
  downwards to warm and saturate the underlying snow before becoming mobile
  enough to flow off the icesheet (Pfeffer et al., 1991, J.Geophys.Res., 96,
  22117-22124). We emphasize that this is applied in our post-processing codes
  and not in the GENESIS physics.

* A correction for the difference between spectrally truncated AGCM topography
  and untruncated surface-grid topography can optionally be applied to the 
  values of AGCM meteorological variables passed to LSX at each time step. 
  In general the untruncated topography is higher in the center of small-scale
  features such as Greenland, and the main motivation is to improve the 
  simulated snow and ice melt rates on icesheets. The lowest-level AGCM air
  temperature is simply reduced assuming a constant lapse rate, the AGCM 
  downward infrared radiation is reduced based on an empirical formula, the
  surface pressure is reduced hydrostatically and the specific humidity is 
  reduced assuming constant relative humidity. Options are to apply this
  correction (i) everywhere, (ii) over all icesheets points, (iii) just over
  Greenland and Antarctica, or (iv) not at all. We emphasize that this only
  affects meteorological values passed to LSX, and the AGCM fields themselves
  are not changed.

* The albedo of bare melting ice on icesheets has been raised slightly beyond
  the envelope of observational estimates, in order to achieve good estimates
  of the present-day net annual mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. The
  melting ice albedos for the two model wavebands (visible and near-IR) are
  0.85 and 0.65 respectively, although we may reduce them in the near future.
  (These ramp up to 0.90 and 0.70 for ice-surface temperatures of -5 deg C
  and below).


--------------
Sea Ice Model:
--------------

* The thermodynamic sea-ice code and arrays are no longer mingled with the
  soil model, and now form a distinct thermodynamic sea-ice module. 
  Consequently the number of sea-ice layers can be different from the number
  of soil layers, and in version 2.0 we use 3 sea-ice layers (an upper layer
  of 5 cm and equispaced adaptive middle and lower layers).

* The algorithm for iterating the sea-ice dynamics to the Flato-Hibler
  solution has been improved and vectorizes much more efficiently.

* The annual mean ocean currents prescribed for sea-ice dynamics are obtained
  from a 5-year run of a 2x2 degree ocean GCM (Esther Brady, personal
  communication), which seems to have alleviated the spiky nature of the
  sea-ice fields near the North Pole in version 1.02.

* The surface winds used for sea-ice dynamics come from the AGCM itself,
  and not from prescribed monthly climatological winds as in version 1.02.

* For prescribed SSTs and sea ice, the ice fractions are now:
      Northern Hemisphere: linear vs. latitude, from 0.998 at 90 deg N
                           to 0.92 at and below 70 deg N.
      Southern Hemisphere: 0.90.

  For the slab ocean and sea-ice model the ice fraction is predicted,
  but with imposed maxima of 0.998 in the Northern Hemisphere and 0.94 in the
  Southern Hemisphere.

* The implicit statistical distribution of ice fraction versus thickness
  used to relate reductions in mean thickness to changes in mean ice fraction
  is now triangular between 0 and 2*mean_thickness. (In version 1.02 it was
  uniform between 0 and 2*mean_thickness). 


-----------------------------
Ocean Slab Mixed-Layer Model:
-----------------------------

* The neutral drag coefficient used in the calculation of ocean surface 
  momentum flux now depends on wind speed (Large and Pond, 1981, J.Phys.
  Oceanogr., 11, 324-336; Trenberth et al., 1982, NCAR Tech.Note TN-338, pg.8).
  The drag coefficient is increased slightly to allow for some scatter of wind
  speeds about the model mean. The roughness length for surface fluxes of heat
  and water vapor has been changed to .0001 m (which is the main factor in
  correcting the overestimate of global precipitation in version 1.02).

* Oceanic heat transport is treated differently in version 2.0. Instead of
  prescribing the convergence (W/m2) as a function of latitude as in version
  1.02, we fitted the present-day observed zonal mean transport as a linear
  function of the latitudinal SST gradient, but with the diffusion coefficient
  depending on the zonal fraction of land vs. ocean, and on latitude itself.
  Those coefficients are used to calculate the 2-D linear diffusion of heat
  vs. SST at each model timestep. Convergence under 100% sea ice is set to
  0 (zero!) in the Northern Hemisphere, and to 6 W m-2 in the Southern
  Hemisphere. Also the enhanced winter flux convergence in the Norwegian Sea
  rectangular region is still as in version 1.02 (but can be turned off by
  QNORWEG = 0).
