README_DOCS
-----------

The Docs subdirectory contains various GENESIS GCM documentation files.

The last full User's Guide was written in 1995 for version 2.0, and updates 
since then are described in release notes for versions 2.0.a, 2.1 and 3.
Nb: Some of the changes described in the later release notes are quite 
   significant, concerning input parameters, output formats, and model physics. 

A set of old GENESIS GCM web pages (circa 1996) are archived at 
http://www.essc.psu.edu/genesis/.
