The Utilities subdirectory contains various pre or post-processing utility
programs for use with the GENESIS GCM. See comments at the start of each
file for more information.  

   Filename           Description
   --------           -----------
   accessnet_v3       Unix script+Fortran code to read a history field from a 
                      NetCDF history file. Its main program is intended to be
                      adapted by the user to read selected fields, and output 
                      them as desired.

   convnetonly_v3     Unix script+Fortran code to compute global annual means 
                      of selected fields from a NetCDF history file, and write 
                      values to an ascii file. Called once per year by the
                      deb$exp script.

                      convnetonly_v3 is called once per year by Genesis v3 
                      deb$exp script, near the end of that file after the 
                      GCM has run through the year. Each ascii file is named
                      conl_${exp}${yearlab}, where yearlab is the year number 
                      and exp is the experiment label. After several years of 
                      an experiment have run, a list of global annual mean 
                      temperatures can be generated by typing:
                        grep -i ': ts2 ' conl*
                      Similarly, for sea-ice fraction:
                        grep -i ': icef ' conl*

   mapinout           Fortran subroutines to read and write a typical 
                      GENESIS data input file (ascii, map-format).
